# Webapp TODO

Follow-ups from the move to Vite 8 / React 19 / Blueprint 6, then to TanStack Query / Zustand / function components (October 2026), most valuable first.
Check items off or delete them when done, add new ones with enough context for someone else to pick them up.

## Bugs / risks
- [ ] **Check the viewers on staging after the state migration**: images (OpenSeadragon/IIIF, auto-ROIs, crops), ToF point clouds, SLAM, flame graphs, bit-accuracy trees, the tuning forms. They now fetch files with TanStack Query and `fetch` instead of axios, and most were rewritten as function components. Unit tests cover their logic, not their rendering.
- [ ] **Old plotly figures**: plotly.js@3 dropped deprecated attributes. `src/components/PlotlyPlot.jsx` upgrades string titles and `titlefont`, but figures with other removed attributes (`bardir`, `annotation.ref`, `autotick`, `heatmapgl`/`pointcloud` traces...) may render differently. Extend `upgradeFigure` if users report it.
- [ ] **Node on SIRC GitLab runners** is 22.14 (`deployments/sirc/.envrc`), close to the minimum the toolchain supports (22.12). Move them to Node 24 LTS like Docker and GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Viewers not covered by automated tests with real data: images (OpenSeadragon/IIIF), ToF point clouds (three.js), SLAM, flame graphs, videos. Check them manually on staging after deploys that touch them.

## UX
- [ ] **History page sidebar** (`src/AppSider.jsx`): it only links back to the branch's commits. Integrations and milestones could be shown there too.
- [ ] Blueprint warns that `<Popover>` positions content incorrectly with React 19: migrate to `<PopoverNext>` (milestones, CommitRow, CommitNavbar...) and check the layouts.

## Testing / CI
- [ ] Run the Playwright smoke tests (`npm run e2e`) in GitLab CI too. They run in GitHub Actions; the LSF runners need Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium` through the proxy, or use `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`).
- [ ] Extend `e2e/smoke.spec.js` with realistic fixtures (batches, outputs, metrics) to cover the viewers and the tuning forms (Monaco).
- [ ] Bring down the last 33 oxlint warnings (`npm run lint`, see TODO_WARTS.md at the repo root), then make more rules errors.

## Architecture
- [ ] **Two class components are left**: `ImgViewer` (`src/viewers/images/images.jsx`, OpenSeadragon) and `TofOutputCard` (`src/viewers/tof/`, three.js). Convert them together with the OpenSeadragon/three.js upgrades below, when someone can check them visually.
- [ ] The React Compiler skips 5 components/hooks it can't compile yet (try/catch with optional chaining, `finally`, one internal error in `src/viewers/text.jsx`): `REACT_COMPILER_LOG=1 npm run build` lists them. Fine as is, revisit with newer compiler versions.
- [ ] `TuningForm` saves to localStorage (zustand `persist`) on every keystroke, including in Monaco. Debounce if it shows up in profiles.
- [ ] Routes keep our own matching (`src/router.jsx`): `/:project_id+/...` can't be expressed with react-router's or TanStack Router's patterns.
- [ ] New files in TypeScript (`.tsx`); `npm run typecheck` already runs in CI.
- [ ] styled-components is in maintenance mode: prefer CSS modules for new code. We keep v5 prop-forwarding behaviour via `StyleSheetManager` in `src/App.jsx`; using transient props (`$isExpanded`) would let us drop it.

## Dependencies left behind
- [ ] three.js 0.136 -> current: our copies of `OrbitControls`/`PCDLoader`/`PointerLockControls` (`src/viewers/tof/`) can come from `three/examples/jsm`. Colors change since r152 (color management), check point clouds visually.
- [ ] OpenSeadragon 3 -> 6: our plugins (`src/viewers/images/{selection,rgb,filtering,filters}.js`) need porting.
- [ ] d3-flame-graph 4 -> 5, react-full-screen -> Fullscreen API.
- [ ] plotly.js 4: wait for it to mature. It shows an "Upload to Cloud" button by default, disable it when upgrading.
