"""Describe the git host of projects: add `hosting_type` and `host` to projects.data['git']

Revision ID: d1a6c0f9e2b3
Revises: cda62d01ead8
Create Date: 2026-10-06 12:00:00.000000

Before git hosts were configurable, projects.data['git'] was GitLab's push webhook `project`,
or for GitHub a few fields and hosting_type='github'. We find the host of each project (see backend/git_hosts)
from its web_url, or qaboard.yaml's project.url, and the configured hosts. Like before, we default to GITLAB_HOST.

Data only: idempotent (only projects without hosting_type or host are updated), in batches.
The code still works with projects that were not migrated, so the downgrade does nothing.
